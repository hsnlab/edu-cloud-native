# Local Kubernetes (k3s) environment for practices

## Summary

This folder contains scripts for creating an emulated local Kubernetes environment as a
backup for practices.

For the K3s environment, the scripts use the tool [k3d](https://github.com/k3d-io/k3d)
to create and configure a multi-node cluster over docker containers serving as K8s nodes 
on a single VM or laptop, which uses the docker-in-docker approach with some little magic
to initiate pods over them.

Currently, platforms based on **Ubuntu 24.04** are tested and used with these scripts. 

The scripts perform the following operations:
 - install requirements and system dependencies, including `docker`, `k3d`, and `kubectl`,
 - carry out minor validation checks of the deployment configuration,
 - creating a local Kubernetes cluster with names reflecting the given practice,
 - prepare the K8s environment for the practice by executing tailored setup steps,
e.g., custom image builds, etc.

## Scripts

- [setup_k3d_env.sh](setup_k3d_env.sh) - Install dependencies and perform validations.
- [practice_06_k8s_intro.sh](practice_06_k8s_intro.sh) - Set up an environment for Practice 06.

## Usage

### Preparation

To install and update the dependencies, execute the script
```bash
$ ./setup_k3d_env.sh -u
```

For other flags, try `setup_k3d_env.sh -h`.

This setup script should be executed only once in a VM.

### Practices

To create the environment of a given practice, execute the dedicated script 
with the name `practice_<num>_*.sh`.

For other features, e.g., tearing down the environment, check the help using `-h`.

For example,
```bash
# setup cluster
$ ./practice_06_k8s_intro.sh
# delete cluster
$ ./practice_06_k8s_intro.sh -d
# cleanup 
$ ./practice_06_k8s_intro.sh -c
```

`k3d` automatically modifies the default cluster, thus the `kubectl` command can be used
directly after cluster creation.

## Good to know

- At every cluster creation, the _current context_ is rewritten in the default kubeconfig file.
To check the available `k3d` cluster configs or select another context, see `cat ~/.kube/config`
or consult with `kubectl config --help`.

- Custom-built docker images must be imported into the cluster using the `k3d image import` command.

- By default, `k3d` also initiates a load balancer as a separate container alongside the cluster
node containers for easier access to exposed services. Requests directed to the load balancer
are seamlessly proxied to the cluster nodes in the background.
In case a port is exposed on the load balancer (by providing the port for cluster creation with
`-p 80:80@loadbalancer`), an external service can be accessed using `http://localhost:80`.

- Configurations based on public domain names can be tested by using domain names `*.localhost`.
For exemple, accessing to an ingress service via the load balancer, the URL 
`http://my-external-svc.my-domain.localhost:80` can be used.

- Ports exposed on nodes (e.g., `NodePort`) can be accessed on load balancer or directly on the
"cluster node" containers provided it is set for `k3d` during cluster creation
(e.g.,`-p 30003:30003@server:0:direct`).
Check documentation [here](https://k3d.io/v5.3.0/usage/exposing_services/).

- Latest version _v5.8.3_ of `k3d` does not support _K8s Gateway API_ by default.
For an option to configure the _Gateway API_ with latest `traefik` version manually, check
[this description](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/getting-started/kubernetes/).
Nevertheless, _Ingress_ routes work just fine.

## Practices

### Practice 06 (K8s intro)

1. (Service) For accessing the created external service, you can use `127.0.0.1` or 
`localhost` as the "External IP".
2. (Ingress) For accessing the created ingress, configure and use an arbitrary `localhost`
domain, e.g., `my-service-http.practice06.localhost`.
